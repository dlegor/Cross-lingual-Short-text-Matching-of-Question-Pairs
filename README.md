# Cross-lingual short text matching of Question Pairs.
Mini project about Cross-lingual Short-text Matching.

# Description 

After the CIKM 2018 AnalytiCup, I was interested in different algorithms and cross-language techniques. For example, the [MUSE](https://github.com/facebookresearch/MUSE) project.

This repository is about my exploration of these algorithms.
